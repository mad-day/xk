 *     is an element of several lists, for example:
 *
 *     - A hashtable bucket for quick object/offset lookup.
 *       (not yet implemented!)
 *
 *     - A list of all pages for a given object.
 *
 *     - An ordered list of pages due for pageout.
 *
 *
 *     Fields in this structure are locked eighter by the lock on the
 *     object that the page belongs to (O) or by the lock on the page
 *     queues (P). Some fields require that both locks be held to change
 *     that field; holding either lock is sufficient to read.
